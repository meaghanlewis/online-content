# Choosing content

- Things you already know
- Things you want to know
- Things other people want to know
- Things you want to learn

## Take inventory and reuse
- What content do you already have?

## Create something new
- What content might you want to develop?
- What's something new you want to learn?
- Focus on one topic or a variety? Breadth vs depth?

## Tips
- Reuse content whenever possible
- Keep virtual events to an hour

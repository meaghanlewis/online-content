# Choosing content

Start by thinking about these 4 things:
- Things you already know
  - What's a skill that you know well?
- Things you already have
  - What content do you already have and can reuse or repurpose?
- Things other people want to know
  - What is something that other people want to learn about?
- Things you want to learn
  - What's something you want to learn about and can share your journey about learning?

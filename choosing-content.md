# Choosing content

Start by thinking about these 4 things:
- Things you already know
  - What content do you already have and can reuse or repurpose?
- Things you want to know
  - What's a question you want to answer or a topic you want to explore more?
- Things other people want to know
  - What is something you've learned or a skill you have you can share?
- Things you want to learn
  - What's something you want to learn about and can share your journey about learning?
